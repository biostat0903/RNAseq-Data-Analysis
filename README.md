# RNAseq-Data-Analysis
The repository includes the algorithms for RNA-Seq data analysis, including differentially expressed (DE) and interactions. 

## [isoVCT](https://peerj.com/articles/3797/)

Variance Component Test with isoform (isoVCT) is an algorithm for identifying the DE genes for next generation seqencing (NGS) data. It can also automatically select a suitable distribution (Poisson or nagative binomial) of each gene. 

### Getting Started 
First, you will need to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) as well as the packages listed under the requirements header below. All of the packages you can download by R. <br>
The packages are as followingï¼š `lem4, pipeR, MASS`

### Support
Before contacting us, please try the following: <br>
* The wiki has tutorials on RNA-Seq data, differentially expressed and variance component test, score statistics and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM).<br>
* The methods are described in the [papers](https://peerj.com/articles/3797/). <br>

If that doesn't work, you can get in touch with us via the email.
